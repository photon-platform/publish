Automated Publishing
====================

    We create tools for gathering, processing, and publishing content.

*   **Automated Indexing:** Taxonomies and collections are generated automatically.
*   **Multi-Format Publishing:** The same content can be published as a website, a PDF, an ebook, or a slide deck.

GitHub Actions
--------------

We use **GitHub Actions** as our continuous integration and deployment engine.

*   **Build on Push:** Every commit triggers a build to ensure the documentation is always valid.
*   **Deploy to Pages:** Successful builds are automatically deployed to GitHub Pages.
*   **Custom Workflows:** We can define custom workflows for specific needs, such as publishing to PyPI or running tests.
