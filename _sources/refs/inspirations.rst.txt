Inspirations
============

:categories: reference

We stand on the shoulders of giants. Our work is inspired by these excellent projects:

*   `Grav CMS <https://getgrav.org/>`_: A modern flat-file CMS that inspired our theme structure and flexibility.
*   `Read the Docs <https://readthedocs.org/>`_: The gold standard for hosting documentation.
*   `Ablog <https://ablog.readthedocs.io/>`_: A Sphinx extension that converts any documentation project into a blog.
*   `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_: The powerful documentation generator that powers everything we do.
