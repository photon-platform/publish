The Mission
-----------

The mission of **Publish** is to create tools for gathering, processing, and publishing content. We believe that content structures should be versatile, capable of being transformed into many form factors.

Our vision is captured in the mantra: **"Simple HTML, State of the Art CSS"**.

We emphasize the **cascade** in CSS, thinking hierarchically all the way down to the last HTML tag. By keeping the HTML semantic and clean, we allow the CSS to do the heavy lifting of presentation, ensuring flexibility and maintainability.

Hierarchical Thinking
---------------------

Content is organized in a strict hierarchy, which allows for:

*   **Predictable Navigation:** Users always know where they are.
*   **Scoped Styling:** CSS can target specific sections or levels of the hierarchy.
*   **Automated Aggregation:** Tools like the `collection` directive can easily gather content from sub-sections.

This structure is reflected in our file organization, URL structure, and navigation menus.
